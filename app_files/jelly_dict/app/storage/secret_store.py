"""Secure storage for API keys and other secrets.

Keys are stored in the OS-level secret store (macOS Keychain via the
``keyring`` library). They are NEVER written to settings.json or any other
file inside the project tree. The only fallback is an environment variable
intended for tests/CI.

Design contract:
- ``set``/``get``/``delete`` are the only public surface.
- The returned secret is held in memory only by the caller; this module
  never logs or repr's the value.
- A ``key_set`` predicate allows the UI to show an on/off indicator without
  reading the value back.
