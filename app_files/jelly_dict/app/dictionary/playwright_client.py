"""Playwright headless client for fetching Naver dictionary pages.

Per dev.md §16-A:
  - Network egress lives only in this module.
  - Domain whitelist is enforced via page.route().
  - Single global rate limiter throttles requests.

Uses WebKit (Safari engine) — macOS-native, lighter than Chromium, and
generally less likely to trip aggressive bot detection on Korean sites.
Run `playwright install webkit` to fetch the engine.

Threading model:
  Playwright's sync API can only be driven from the thread that started
  it. We run the browser inside a single dedicated daemon thread and
  communicate through a thread-safe queue, so any caller (UI, worker
  threads, tests) can call fetch() safely.
